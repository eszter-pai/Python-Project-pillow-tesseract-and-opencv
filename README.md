</p>
The final capstone of Python 3 Programming Specialization offered by University of Michigan via Coursera.


### Task
- Take a ZIP file of images and process them, using a library built into python that you need to learn how to use. 
- A ZIP file takes several different files and compresses them, thus saving space, into one single file. The files in the ZIP file we provide are newspaper images.

### Test my ability to
- use OpenCV to detect faces
- use tesseract to do optical character recognition
- use PIL to composite images together into contact sheets.

Each page of the newspapers is saved as a single PNG image in a file called images.zip. These newspapers are in english, and contain a variety of stories, advertisements and images. 
The follwoing is the expect output of the search for the string 'Mark'
